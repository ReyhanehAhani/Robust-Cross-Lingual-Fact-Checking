# Robust Cross-Lingual Fact-Checking

## Portfolio — Pillar 3 (Label Studio)

Human-in-the-loop adjudication assets live under `label_studio/` (XML interface + starter JSON tasks). **Completed demo export:** `label_studio/published/demo_annotations.json` (ready to import / attach as proof of schema).

This project investigates **multilingual fact-checking** using XLM-RoBERTa, with a focus on robustness to adversarial noise, parameter-efficient fine-tuning using **LoRA**, and evidence integration using **retrieval and summarization** pipelines. We address both **claim-only** settings and **evidence-rich** tasks across multiple languages.

## Overview

1. **Cross-lingual Fact Verification:**  
   - Fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-base and large on the multilingual **X-Fact** dataset.
   - Evaluated robustness under synthetic character-level perturbations (10%, 30%, 60%).
   - Applied **adversarial fine-tuning** using noisy samples.
   - Conducted **gradient-based sensitivity analysis** across languages and labels.

2. **Monolingual Evidence-Based Verification (SciFact):**  
   - Developed a multi-stage **retrieval + summarization pipeline** using FLAN-T5, Wikipedia API, and BART.
   - Fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa on SciFact and tested under four settings:
     - With and without fine-tuning
     - With and without evidence retrieval

3. **Baselines:**  
   - Compared performance against **LOKI**, an open-source multilingual fact-checking tool.

## Approach Summary

### Multilingual Fine-Tuning (X-Fact)
- Model: `XLM-RoBERTa-{base,large}` + LoRA (r=128)
- Noise: Evaluated 10% / 30% / 60% char-level perturbations
- Metrics: F1 (weighted), Accuracy, Recall
- Robustness: Enhanced via adversarial training
- Hardware: 2× T4 GPUs (Kaggle Accelerators)

### Gradient Sensitivity
- Computed gradient norms of input embeddings
- Revealed which languages or label classes showed vulnerability

### Retrieval + Summarization (SciFact)
- Query reformulation: FLAN-T5 (zero-shot)
- Document retrieval: Wikipedia API
- Paragraph ranking: SentenceTransformer (multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1)
- Summarization: facebook/bart-large-cnn (two-stage)
